          "Chelsey Davis “I had the pleasure of working with Poojitha during her internship at Crossbeam, and I can confidently say she has been an incredible asset to our team. Starting her internship on the very first day of the Reveal and Crossbeam merger—a time of significant change and adjustment—Poojitha took it all in stride with a positive attitude and unwavering enthusiasm. One of Poojitha’s standout qualities is her ability to quickly learn new tools and processes. She doesn’t just familiarize herself with them; she dives deep to understand how to make a meaningful impact. Whether it’s jumping in to help on any project or bringing thoughtful, creative ideas to the table, Poojitha consistently goes above and beyond expectations. She’s unafraid to share her perspective, which has been invaluable in shaping our work. A few of her notable contributions include building out an onboarding flow for our Crossbeam for Sales product—a crucial project for our overall customer experience. Prior to her work, customers were left to navigate the product on their own. Thanks to Poojitha, we now have a structured, user-friendly onboarding flow that sets customers up for success. She also made significant strides in creating sales collateral, including sales overview decks for Crossbeam, Crossbeam for Sales, and Crossbeam Copilot. Her efforts extended to creating product demo tours for our website, showcasing our platform’s capabilities, and assisting with emails, in-app communications, and other marketing materials. Poojitha’s ability to adapt, her creativity, and her willingness to roll up her sleeves and tackle any challenge have made her an integral part of our team. I’m confident she will excel in whatever she pursues next, and I wholeheartedly recommend her for any opportunity that comes her way. She’s an absolute star, and I can’t wait to see all that she achieves in the future!”",
          "Adèle Quéméner “I had the pleasure of working with Poojitha at Crossbeam, and she impressed me with how quickly she learned about Crossbeam’s product and processes. She created great content to promote Crossbeam to the right users. Poojitha is very autonomous, proactive and always has a very positive mindset. Working with her is a great experience!”"
