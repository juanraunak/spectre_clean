During our interactions in HSBC I found her to be extremely polite, helpful, resourceful and creative person. Her ability to connect with people is a great a skill where she is able to share ideas and knowledge with new people easily. Olivia is a fast learner and picks things to quickly. She will add tremendous value to any organization. I wish her all the very best.”",
            "Sarang Kanchan “I have known Olivia for a good eleven years. While we have remained connected as peers for a decade, we have worked on multiple assignments and competitions together while at Indian School of Business, Hyderabad. Olivia carries a 'never say die spirit' which when coupled with her commitment to logic and the need to review any business decision from the psyche of the customer , develops insights that identify and optimize the value drivers of any business. This helps her in resolving business problems across a wide spectrum- be it in the Information Technology change implementation at a phygital bank or as a product manager humanising collected big data or as a consultant solving marketing strategy conundrums for startups of various stripes. The quality of her implementation is a testament to the viewpoint that she brings to the table. I wholeheartedly recommend her and would love to work with her again! ”"

Sales, financial services, mass processes, debt collections, administration of facilities, security and anti-fraud, legal and compliance, securitisation, debt sale, financial market, call-centres, product development, network management, incentives schemes – these are areas I have dealt with. What makes me valuable for an organisation is my creativity, freshness of outlook and ability of rethinking and redesigning processes. My strong international legal background makes me confident while operating in foreign legal environments. I have unique crisis management experience as well as outstanding ability of learning and adapting to the demanding work environment. In addition, I am skilled in mentoring and have got a couple of successful stories of helping my subordinates to achieve new level in their performance, maturity and career. Therefore, several times I was able to successfully run difficult projects with junior team who had no relevant experience. I have excellent command of time management.",

Jakub has the ability to lead from the front while deliver long-term impact.”",

If there is a job to do, he does it. A great manager and a strategic planner. Self-confident, and goal oriented. When he starts doing the project, nothing can stop him until it is done according to the agreed schedule. At the same time he is a great motivator and a mentor to other people. For me personally - the real model to follow. I admire him for his determination and consequence in activity. Jakub is a person with a great dose of humor, too. It is a pure pleasure to know him and even more to work with him. It is a person from who I could have learned a lot, too. Thank you Jakub for this opportunity.”"

            "Kevin Knowles “I worked with Dilip during my time at _VOIS, and he was one of the most capable colleagues I had the pleasure to work with. He is calm, capable, thorough and diligent, and always produced work to the highest quality. He has excellent interpersonal skills and engaged with stakeholders across the business at multiple levels. No matter the project or topic, no matter the challenge, I could rely on him to get the job done and do it with a smile. I recommend him without hesitation, he would be an asset to any team.”",
            "Pooja Kiran “Writing this recommendation for Dilip is a great privilege and honor. He isn't simply a mentor; but a catalyst for innovation. His exceptional talent, strategic brilliance, and leadership have profoundly impacted not just my career, but the entire organization. Witnessing his passion for leveraging Gen AI has been inspiring, and his unwavering support during challenging moments solidified his role as a guiding light. When our Project on Leveraging Gen AI into incident management project floundered due to an unclear problem statement and ambiguous success metrics, Dilip didn't hesitate to dive in. His sharp mind meticulously dissected the issue, guiding us towards a well-defined objective and measurable outcomes. Today, the project's resounding success stands as a testament to his strategic foresight and problem-solving prowess. Dilip's vision extends far beyond tactical solutions. His 'Eye Control' project, a marvel of engineering ingenuity, showcased his dedication to pushing the boundaries of Gen AI. Imagine, controlling your computer through eye movements! This ambitious endeavor, initially met with skepticism, materialized into a game-changer, revolutionizing accessibility within the company. This is the mark of a true innovator, someone who doesn't shy away from audacious ideas and possesses the talent to bring them to life. His mentorship extends beyond technical expertise. He possesses an uncanny ability to identify and nurture potential in others. I personally experienced this when feeling discouraged by unforeseen roadblocks. His unwavering belief in my abilities, coupled with his insightful guidance, instilled the confidence needed to overcome the challenges and emerge stronger. Dilip is more than just a talented individual; he's a visionary leader who inspires, empowers, and revolutionizes. His strategic acumen, coupled with his passion for Gen AI, makes him a force to be reckoned with in this exciting field. I wholeheartedly recommend him, confident that he will continue to contribute groundbreaking innovations and leave a lasting impact on the future of technology. Best wishes Pooja Kiran”"

          "about": "I built a $100M+ growth engine by unifying fragmented data into AI-ready, compliant ecosystems for fintech and global enterprises. With 20+ years across Data, AI, and Digital Strategy, I’ve led transformation at global scale—working with CEOs, CTOs, and product leaders to turn fragmented data into intelligent growth engines. At MoneyLion, as Head of Data & AI Solutions (reporting to the Global CTO), I led the CEO-sponsored CDP and User 360 strategy—the foundational layer for our digital marketing, CX, and GenAI ambitions. This initiative: - Delivered 10X uplift in revenue through personalization and full-funnel automation - Enabled 2M new user acquisitions at the lowest CAC in our category - Achieved a 5X reduction in CAC via ML-powered audience segmentation and Martech integration Before that, at Yodlee, I built a scalable Financial Data Enrichment Platform using ML/DL techniques, enabling AI-driven personalization for global financial institutions. I led the deployment of several AI/ML solutions—spanning MLOps, anomaly detection, and smart categorization—driving over $8M in measurable value across products and partnerships. I worked with CPG giant Procter & Gamble for over a decade. At P&G I pioneered Industry 4.0 AI/ML adoption in manufacturing. In 2017, I piloted one of the industry’s first prognostics ML solutions on the shop floor—improving asset availability from ~60% to 85% (+25%). This made a financial impact of $15M Through this cross-industry lens, I operate at the intersection of CDO, CAIO, and CTO mandates—blending architecture, governance, and growth strategy into scalable impact. Today, I share my frameworks and field-tested playbooks through TransformTechX—a content ecosystem for leaders building the next generation of AI-powered enterprises. 📬 Let’s connect if you're shaping a GenAI, Martech, or growth transformation agenda—especially in Financial Services, D2C, or digital-first industries. 🔑 Core Skills: Data Strategy | Generative AI | AI/ML Architecture | CDP & Customer 360 | Digital Marketing | MLOps | Cloud Platforms (AWS, Snowflake) | Martech | Industry 4.0 | AI Governance | Fintech + FMCG Innovation | Executive Stakeholder Management",
