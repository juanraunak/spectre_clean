Anyone who has the opportunity to work with him will not only be impressed but genuinely grateful.”",
            "Evan Fabio “I worked for Saurabh last year. A lot have been said about his excellent knowledge and skills, but what I'd like to talk about him as a leader and a human being. Saurabh has that kind of charisma and empathy that makes me want to give my best every time I step into the office. He is the kind of leader that you can trust since day 0, the one that always has your back in whatever situation that may arise. Saurabh was always the first person to give credit publicly, but he also never hesitated about giving constructive feedback privately. I don't really give recommendation to others, but Saurabh is an exception. Any company would be lucky to have his presence in the office, given that you can endure his unique sense of humor every now and then.”"

Engaging in yoga, meditation, and exploring new destinations through travel also keeps me energized and inspired. My ambition is to further develop my career as a Financial/Data/Risk Analyst, bringing my unique blend of analytical rigor, innovative thinking, and adaptability to a forward-thinking multinational firm. Currently, I amalso working towards achieving certifications as a Financial Risk Manager (FRM) and Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) to deepen my expertise and add value to the organizations I serve.

The study introduces a novel approach to assessing IGF, using BRICS and four Central European economies as examples to reveal key trends and performance metrics. It evaluates the financial structure of selected economies using World Bank and IMF data sets on financial inclusion, alongside indicators of green finance and innovation. The bunch of data are analysed with the help of three sub-indices contrasting the methodology of the HDI and the positivity constrained version of the two-stage PCA to reach a more stable and consistent evaluation. We find that though the ranking of emerging economies largely depends on the selection of the data set, the composite indicator based on the two-stage PCA provides more balanced results. Overall, the composite indicator developed in this study equips policymakers and international organisations with a practical tool to track progress in financial inclusion and green finance, enabling cross-country comparisons and timely interventions."

AbstractThis paper examines the role of investment funds in Hungary's economic development, highlighting their growth, diversification, and impact on the financial landscape. Since their inception in 1992, investment funds in Hungary have evolved significantly, contributing to 20% of the country's GDP by the end of 2021. The study traces the development from initial closed-end funds focused on domestic securities to a diversified portfolio that includes real estate, sovereign debt, bond, and equity funds. Key shifts in asset allocation from 2010 to 2021 are noted, with a decline in money market and guaranteed funds and a surge in real estate and mixed funds. The paper underscores the importance of investment funds as unique financial intermediaries, actively managing assets and influencing market transactions. Detailed financial data reflects the sector's profitability and resilience, despite temporary setbacks from the European debt crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The study concludes that investment funds are crucial drivers of Hungary's economic growth, showcasing robust investor confidence and continuous asset growth, cementing their role in the nation's financial stability and progress."

The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.Context: This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget."
