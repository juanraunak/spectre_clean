I have summed up my recommendation for him in a poem: He came, He coded, He conquered All of our hearts and gained our respect & admiration A beautiful human being without prejudice, a rare find Polite, soft-spoken, mischievous, socially active & popular Always dedicated to improvement and excellence Always ready to lend a helping hand Sometimes a mentor, Sometimes a friend No stress, no pressure could ever make him bend Hoping that the fire in your belly never goes out And your conquest of hearts & accolades shall continue, I have no doubt I pray that you are successful in all walks of life I pray you are kept away from hurdle or strife It’s sad that you are leaving but I know you have to part So I wish you farewell and good luck on your new start I would highly recommend Pritesh for a leadership role.”"

She is a high performing professional with thorough knowledge of the higher education industry. Her extensive outreach and effective communication has helped us partner with some of the very established Institutions. She has not only showcased high level of initiative in developing these collaborations but also nurtured the relationship with her clients. If not for moving to France, she would have continued with us in India. I highly recommend her for being such an asset to the organisation.” Show less"

          "about": "“Justice isn't found in the loudest argument, but in the sharpest understanding — and it is this precision that defines my practice of law.” With 7+ years of cross-border legal experience in the UAE and India, I bring proven expertise in litigation management, corporate legal advisory, and regulatory compliance. I’ve represented VVIP clients, NBFCs like DHFL, and global FinTechs in fraud, cybercrime, financial offenses, SARFAESI recoveries, and arbitration enforcement, appearing before courts in Dubai, Delhi, Chandigarh, and Allahabad. My work has led to high-value outcomes, including AED 1M in fraud litigation damages and AED 78K in medical negligence compensation. As Senior Legal Associate at Kaden Boriss & NYK Law Firm (Dubai), I lead junior teams and handle complex criminal and family law cases, securing bail approvals in sensitive narcotics and commercial matters. I’ve overseen M&A agreements, shareholder contracts, due diligence reports, and compliance frameworks tailored to UAE and Indian laws. At Lex Legal (India), I managed DRT/DRAT recoveries, cheque dishonor litigation, and negotiated out-of-court settlements that mitigated reputational risk. My achievements include favorable verdicts in high-stakes civil liability and asset recovery cases, driving litigation strategies that ensured regulatory alignment. I hold a BBA LLB (Hons) from Jaipur School of Law and completed legal internships at VAS Global and the Rajasthan High Court, gaining early exposure to service law and constitutional matters. Strategic, discreet, and outcomes-driven, I offer business-aligned legal solutions that meet evolving regulatory demands and strengthen enterprise-wide legal resilience.",

Lakshmi came to us as a recent graduate of Mechanical and Automation Engineering from Tampere University. She exhibited a rare combination of speed and accuracy that has enabled her to produce a very high volume of work while maintaining excellent standards for quality. Lakshmi can work on multi-layered tasks and has a can-do attitude. Her strong verbal and written communication skills allowed her to relay information in a clear and coherent manner. As you can tell by now, I am quite impressed with Lakshmi and give her my strongest recommendation for roles that require organization, communication skills, design, and a positive attitude. I know that she will prove herself to be a splendid and productive addition to your team. ” Show less",
            "“Lakshmi BG used her project management skills to run TribeX startup event project during Jan-March 2020. She helped Tampere startup community with her professional output and ability to learn during the process. Lakshmi was very enterprising, and we had quick online conversations when there was a need for guidance and connections. Lakshmi BG managed the TribeX event production really well, as the event was forced to be transformed into online video recording series only 2 weeks before the physical event was supposed to happen. The transformation required exceptional skills to mentally adjust into a new crisis situation, to re-negotiate with the keynote speakers, and to re-create a new marketing plan for startups, investors and companies interested startups. She took care of the event production transformation process and content planning, and led the marketing team to engage the audience. Lakshmi BG's strength was to use her skills and knowledge to benefit Tampere startup community in an impressive way. Lakshmi spreads positive energy into her team, and she is not afraid to voice out her ideas and suggestions. The experience of Lakshmi as a project team member in such event production and business-support functions will be very valuable for the future employers and projects.” Show less"

              "description": "Today, the research is concentrated on designing and developing robots to address the challenges of human life in their everyday activities. The cleaning robots are the class of service robots whose demands are increasing exponentially. Nevertheless, the application of cleaning robots is confined to smaller areas such as homes. Not much autonomous cleaning products are commercialized for big areas such as schools, hospitals, malls, etc. In this project, the proof of concept is designed for the autonomous floor-cleaning robot and autonomous board-cleaning robot for schools. A thorough background study is conducted on domestic service robots to understand the technologies involved in these robots. The components of the vacuum cleaner are assembled on the PULU-M robotic platform. The principles of vacuum cleaning technology and airflow equations are employed for the component selection of the vacuum cleaner. As the autonomous board-cleaning robot acts against gravity, a magnetic adhesion is used to adhere the robot to the classroom board. This system uses a belt drive mechanism to manoeuvre. The use of belt drive increases the area of magnetic attraction while the robot is in motion. A semi-systematic approach using patterned path planning techniques for the complete coverage of the working environment is discussed in this project.The outcome of this project depicts a new and conceptual mechanical design of an autonomous floor-cleaning robot and autonomous board cleaning robot. This evidence creates a preliminary design for proof-of-concept for these robots. This proof of concept design is developed from the basic equations of vacuum cleaning technology, airflow and magnetic adhesion. A general overview is discussed for collaborating the two robots. This research provides an extensive initial step to illustrate the development of an autonomous cleaning robot."
