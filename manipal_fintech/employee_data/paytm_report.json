It is amazing to see mayank work rigorously on various deliverables and proactively adding value to everything he delivers. I wish Mayank all the best for his future endeavors. With his capabilities and potential, he is destined to succeed everywhere ”",
            "Nilesh Soni “I’ve worked with Mayank for two years in Aasaanjobs, and in those two years, I've seen him quickly take on new responsibilities while having the time to teach this information back into his team’s employees. By inheriting product like internal tracking system, growth-hack and many others new product from beginning, which were beyond the scope of our team -- he's made our team much more agile. He is a gifted negotiator with a rare combination of patience, spunk, and research skills. I’m lucky to have worked with Mayank, a manager, mentor who’s not only interested in the company’s bottom line, but also in his employees' growth. Mayank is as great a person as a manager and any employer and employee will be lucky to have him.”"

When I started my internship, he created a development plan with the clear expectation to helped me set sights on career opportunities. He also offered a contact list so I could arrange virtual meetings with business partners and key team members to get more insights into their team structures and goals which also helped me build my network during the pandemic. As a manager, he shows employees that he trust them. This not only let me know what I need to succeed and give me the ownership, but it also shows me that earning trust and credibility is crucial in Amazon.
