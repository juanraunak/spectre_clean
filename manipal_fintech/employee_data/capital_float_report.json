              "description": "Evaluating the factors favoring the onset of influenza epidemics is a critical public health issue for surveillance, prevention and control. While past outbreaks provide important insights for understanding epidemic onsets, their statistical analysis is challenging since the impact of a factor can be viewed at different scales. Indeed, the same factor can explain why epidemics are more likely to begin (i) during particular weeks of the year (global scale); (ii) earlier in particular regions (spatial scale) or years (annual scale) than others and (iii) earlier in some years than others within a region (spatiotemporal scale).Here, we present a statistical approach based on dynamical modeling of infectious diseases to study epidemic onsets. We propose a method to disentangle the role of covariates at different scales and use a permutation procedure to assess their significance. Epidemic data gathered from 18 French regions over six epidemic years were provided by the Regional Influenza Surveillance Group (GROG) sentinel network."

              "description": "Improving knowledge about influenza transmission is crucial to upgrade surveillance network and to develop accurate predicting models to enhance public health intervention strategies. Epidemics usually occur in winter in temperate countries and during the rainy season for tropical countries, suggesting a climate impact on influenza spread. Despite a lot of studies, the role of weather on influenza spread is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we investigated this issue at two different levels. First, we evaluated how weekly (intra-annual) incidence variations of clinical diseases could be linked to those of climatic factors. We considered that only a fraction of the human population is susceptible at the beginning of a year due to immunity acquired from previous years. Second, we focused on epidemic sizes (cumulated number of clinical reported cases) and looked at how their inter-annual and regional variations could be related to differences in the winter climatic conditions of the epidemic years over the regions. We quantified the impact of fifteen climatic variables in France using the Réseau des GROG surveillance network incidence data over eleven regions and nine years."

Sales, financial services, mass processes, debt collections, administration of facilities, security and anti-fraud, legal and compliance, securitisation, debt sale, financial market, call-centres, product development, network management, incentives schemes – these are areas I have dealt with. What makes me valuable for an organisation is my creativity, freshness of outlook and ability of rethinking and redesigning processes. My strong international legal background makes me confident while operating in foreign legal environments. I have unique crisis management experience as well as outstanding ability of learning and adapting to the demanding work environment. In addition, I am skilled in mentoring and have got a couple of successful stories of helping my subordinates to achieve new level in their performance, maturity and career. Therefore, several times I was able to successfully run difficult projects with junior team who had no relevant experience. I have excellent command of time management.",

He brings a rare mix of legal expertise, international experience, and hands-on leadership - not just managing from HQ but personally engaging with field teams - while also driving strategic improvements in risk management, cost efficiency, and tool implementation. Jakub has the ability to lead from the front while deliver long-term impact.”",
            "Edyta Skrobotowicz “I had a chance to work with Jakub on some HR project in India. Jakub is a person who sets goals, and achieves them. He doesn’t spread himself too thin. If there is a job to do, he does it. A great manager and a strategic planner. Self-confident, and goal oriented. When he starts doing the project, nothing can stop him until it is done according to the agreed schedule. At the same time he is a great motivator and a mentor to other people. For me personally - the real model to follow. I admire him for his determination and consequence in activity. Jakub is a person with a great dose of humor, too. It is a pure pleasure to know him and even more to work with him. It is a person from who I could have learned a lot, too. Thank you Jakub for this opportunity.”"
